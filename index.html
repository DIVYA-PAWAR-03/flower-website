            <p class="desc">For most plants, flowers attract pollinators to make seeds, helping plants to reproduce and
                form the next generation. Flowers also play important roles in ecosystems. Floral nectar, pollen and
                even petals are an important food source for a huge range of animals, from bees and beetles to birds and
                bats.
                <br>Their primary purpose is reproduction. During the reproductive process, flowers make use of their
                colorful petals to attract pollinators such as insects and animals. These creatures are also lured by
                the nectar that flowers produce in their nectaries, glands that are often found at the base of their
                petals.Flowers are a vital part of the world's eco-system and are the basis of all life on earth. Not
                only do they produce oxygen for us to breathe, but they also provide food for birds, insects and animals
                on every continent.

            <h2 class="headingbox"><b>Relationship Between Humans and Flowers:</b></h2>
            <img src="./images/text background.jpg" class="bgImg" alt="">
            <p class="box"> The relationship between humans and flowers is special. Humans have always been strangely
                attracted to flowers even when they provide no physical sustenance and when resources are low. Humans
                have also put embodied and physical effort into growing flowers for their aesthetic qualities. Stone
                drawings of flowers were found in ancient Egyptian graves 120,000 years ago, were celebrated in
                festivals in Roman times, and, in China, were created in silk 2000 years ago.

                As stated, this attraction is not on a survival level, as while flowers can provide some basic medicinal
                uses and serve as a sign of the fertility of the land, the main motivation for growing flowers seems to
                be aesthetic. However, this goes beyond perceptual levels, as flowers are a multi-sensory experience
                that includes smell, texture, and color (and an embodied experience, in that one has to actively search
                for flowers with his/her body, to tend them, and to bend over them to smell them). The experience is
                also relational in that flowers are dependent on man’s care; they have to be handled gently, watered,
                and nurtured. On all of these levels, the human interaction and the relationship with flowers seems to
                be an interesting example of embodied aesthetics. This perspective of the relationship between humans
                and flowers, and thus the incentive to grow them, is not well explored in the literature.

                Indeed, embodied phenomenology assumes that our live bodies interacting with the environment are at the
                basis of our phenomenological experience of the world. Flowers are an apt example of being aware of the
                environment around us and of how we engage with the world through skilled interaction through our
                bodies—by using all of our senses. This happens through moving our bodies within space rather than only
                by contemplating the environment. Flowers, as described above, demand us to get close to smell them, to
                move towards them to find them in nature, to water them, to pick them, and to carry them in our <br><br>
                All of this embodied interaction makes them excellent examples and receptors for the experience of
                embodied aesthetics. Tending to and enjoying flowers thus enables us to interact in a skilled fashion
                with the environment and to engage with the world. This behavior clearly creates positive emotions, as
                there is no survival-level incentive to engage with flowers. An exploration of this basic relationship
                to flowers may help us to understand how embodied aesthetics ‘works’ to enhance positive emotions in an
                ancient and enduring context of growing flowers.
                <br>
                As stated, aesthetic and embodied experiences include within them overt perceptual processes, but also,
                additional components that will be outlined below. Firstly, from an evolutionary perspective, the flower
                as a species uses, among others, the strategy of activating humans to grow and to propagate it, just as
                it activates insects with pollen. The plant thus uses its aesthetic characteristics to attract humans.
                In turn, for humans, flowers may evoke positive emotions, because they can help predict food-growing
                possibilities and/or may be used as medicines. They essentially show where man can live healthily. In
                addition, colors of flowers may be helpful in finding ripe fruit against a green background. However, as
                stated above, when man grows ornamental flowers, this evolutionary motivation is lessened. People have
                always actively invested resources in growing ornamental flowers since ancient times.
